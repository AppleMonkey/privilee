# Privilee Venues App - Monorepo Readme

## ðŸ§  Architecture Overview

This project is built using **Clean Architecture** principles, organized in a **Flutter Melos monorepo** setup. The goal is to separate concerns clearly between layers and maintain scalability.

### ðŸ§± Project Structure

```
packages/
â”œâ”€â”€ venue_entity     # Pure Dart models shared across layers (Domain Models)
â”œâ”€â”€ venue_domain     # Contains abstract repositories & use cases
â”œâ”€â”€ venue_data       # Implements data sources and repositories
â”œâ”€â”€ venue_list       # Presentation layer (UI + BLoC + Mappers)
```

### ðŸ”„ Flow

* **Entity Layer:** Defines domain entities shared across layers.
* **Domain Layer:** Declares abstract repositories and use cases.
* **Data Layer:** Implements the domain contracts using remote data (mocked JSON for now).
* **Presentation Layer:** Uses BLoC and mappers to present venue data in the UI.

### âœ… Injection

Dependency injection is managed via:

* [`injectable`](https://pub.dev/packages/injectable)
* [`get_it`](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it)

Build runner is used to auto-generate injection configs.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

### 1. Install Melos if you havenâ€™t:

```bash
flutter pub global activate melos
```

### 2. Bootstrap the workspace:

```bash
melos bootstrap
```

### 3. Clean all packages (optional but recommended before build):

```bash
melos run clean
```

### 4. Generate DI and other build\_runner code:

```bash
melos run build
```

### 5. Run the app:

```bash
flutter run -t lib/main.dart
```

### 6. Tests:

```bash
melos run test
```

## ðŸ“¸ UI Inspiration

The venue list UI uses a **responsive grid** layout with an adaptive number of columns based on screen width. Each item supports a **carousel image viewer** with a **dot indicator** and a placeholder image when no images are available.
